## Introduction to Multi-Threading in Java üöÄ

#### Day 1 - 15-08-2024

#### **üìñ Concept of Multi-Threading**

Multi-threading is a programming concept that allows a process to run multiple threads concurrently, enhancing performance by utilizing the CPU cores more efficiently. Threads are lightweight processes sharing the same memory space, making them faster and more efficient than traditional processes.

#### **‚ú® Advantages of Multi-Threading**

- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple threads concurrently to perform tasks in parallel, optimizing CPU utilization.
- **Responsive UI**: In GUI applications, background threads handle heavy tasks, keeping the user interface responsive.
- **Resource Sharing**: Threads share the same memory space, enabling easier data sharing between them.
- **Real-Time Systems**: Execute multiple tasks simultaneously, essential for applications like simulations and games.

#### **üåü Use Cases of Multi-Threading**

- **Web Servers**: Handle multiple client requests simultaneously.
- **Game Development**: Manage rendering, physics, and AI concurrently.
- **Database Management**: Process multiple queries in parallel.
- **Network Applications**: Manage multiple connections simultaneously, such as in chat applications.

#### **üõ†Ô∏è Implementing a Simple Thread in Java**

To create a thread in Java, extend the `Thread` class or implement the `Runnable` interface. Here's an example:

```java
class SimpleThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SimpleThread thread = new SimpleThread();
        thread.start();  // Start the thread
    }
}
```

#### **‚ùì Multi-Threading Questions to Practice**

1. **Print Numbers Using Multiple Threads**:

   - **Objective**: Create two threads, one printing even numbers and the other printing odd numbers.
   - **Key Concept**: Understanding thread creation and execution.

2. **Simulate a Simple Counter Using Threads**:

   - **Objective**: Implement a thread-safe counter using `synchronized` to prevent race conditions.
   - **Key Concept**: Grasping thread synchronization and shared resource management.

3. **Producer-Consumer Problem Using `wait()` and `notify()`**:
   - **Objective**: Implement the Producer-Consumer problem using thread synchronization.
   - **Key Concept**: Mastering thread communication and coordination.

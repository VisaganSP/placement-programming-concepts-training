### **Q1. What is exception handling?**

_Exception handling_ is a programming mechanism to handle runtime errors or exceptional conditions that disrupt the normal flow of execution. It involves using constructs like `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and `throw` to manage and respond to these errors gracefully.

### **Q2. What is an exception?**

An _exception_ is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. Exceptions are typically used to signal errors or other unusual conditions.  
[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

### **Q3. What are the common exception types in Java/C++?**

In Java, common exception types include `IOException`, `NullPointerException`, and `ArithmeticException`. In C++, common types include `std::exception`, `std::runtime_error`, and `std::logic_error`.  
[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

### **Q4. What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?**

_Checked exceptions_ must be either caught or declared in the method signature with the `throws` keyword. Examples include `IOException` and `SQLException`. _Unchecked exceptions_ do not need to be explicitly handled or declared. They are subclasses of `RuntimeException`, such as `NullPointerException` and `ArithmeticException`.  
[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

### **Q5. What is a try-catch block?**

A _try-catch block_ is used to handle exceptions. The `try` block contains the code that might throw an exception, while the `catch` block contains code that handles the exception if one occurs.  
[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

### **Q6. What is the purpose of the finally block?**

The `finally` block is used to execute code that must run regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. It is commonly used for resource cleanup, such as closing files or releasing resources.  
[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

### **Q7. What is the difference between throw and throws in Java?**

The `throw` keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or block of code. The `throws` keyword is used in a method signature to indicate that the method may throw exceptions and that the caller must handle them.  
[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

### **Q8. What is custom exception handling?**

_Custom exception handling_ involves creating user-defined exception classes to handle specific error conditions in an application. This allows for more precise error reporting and handling.  
[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

### **Q9. How does exception propagation work?**

_Exception propagation_ refers to the process where an exception thrown in a method is passed up the call stack to the methods that invoked it until it is caught by a `catch` block or terminates the program.  
[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

### **Q10. What is the use of the `try-with-resources` statement in Java?**

The `try-with-resources` statement automatically closes resources (like files or streams) that implement the `AutoCloseable` interface, ensuring proper resource management and avoiding resource leaks.  
[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

### **Q11. How does C++ handle exceptions?**

C++ handles exceptions using the `try`, `catch`, and `throw` keywords. Exceptions are objects derived from `std::exception`, and they are propagated up the call stack to be caught and handled by appropriate `catch` blocks.  
[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

### **Q12. What is stack unwinding?**

_Stack unwinding_ is the process of cleaning up the call stack when an exception is thrown. It involves the automatic destruction of objects in the stack frames that are no longer needed, ensuring proper resource release.  
[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

### **Q13. What is the `Throwable` class in Java?**

The `Throwable` class is the superclass of all errors and exceptions in Java. It has two main subclasses: `Error` and `Exception`. All exceptions and errors in Java are derived from this class.  
[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

### **Q14. What is the `Error` class in Java?**

The `Error` class in Java represents serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch. Examples include `OutOfMemoryError` and `StackOverflowError`. Errors are usually not handled by applications.  
[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

### **Q15. What is the `Exception` class in Java?**

The `Exception` class represents conditions that a program should catch and handle. It includes subclasses for various types of exceptions, such as `IOException` and `ArithmeticException`.  
[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

### **Q16. What are some best practices for exception handling?**

- Use exceptions for exceptional conditions, not for control flow.
- Catch specific exceptions rather than general ones.
- Avoid empty catch blocks.
- Use finally or try-with-resources for resource management.
- Provide meaningful error messages and handle exceptions at appropriate levels.  
[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

### **Q17. What is exception chaining?**

_Exception chaining_ involves passing the original exception as a cause to a new exception. This preserves the stack trace and provides context for the original error. In Java, you can use `

Throwable's constructor that accepts a cause.  
[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

### **Q18. What is a finally block used for in C++?**

C++ does not have a `finally` block; however, similar functionality can be achieved using RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) and smart pointers for automatic resource management.  
[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

### **Q19. What is the impact of catching general exceptions?**

Catching general exceptions (like `Exception` in Java) can obscure specific error conditions and make debugging difficult. It can also mask unexpected errors and prevent proper handling of different types of exceptions.  
[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

### **Q20. How do you rethrow an exception in Java?**

In Java, you can rethrow an exception by using the `throw` keyword within a `catch` block. This allows you to handle the exception partially and then pass it up the call stack for further handling.  
[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

### **Q21. What is the role of exception filters in .NET?**

_Exception filters_ in .NET allow you to conditionally handle exceptions based on specific criteria. Filters are used within a `catch` block to determine if the block should handle the exception or pass it on.  
[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

### **Q22. What are some common pitfalls in exception handling?**

- Catching overly broad exceptions.
- Not cleaning up resources properly.
- Ignoring exception handling best practices.
- Overusing exceptions for control flow.
- Failing to provide meaningful error messages.  
[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

### **Q23. What is the `try-catch-finally` pattern?**

The `try-catch-finally` pattern is used to handle exceptions while ensuring that necessary cleanup code is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs. The `finally` block is executed after the `try` and `catch` blocks.  
[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

### **Q24. How do you handle exceptions in asynchronous code?**

In asynchronous code, exceptions are often handled using mechanisms like `try-catch` blocks within asynchronous functions, or by using `Promise` catch handlers or async/await constructs. Proper error handling ensures that exceptions are managed effectively even in non-blocking code.  
[üîù Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

---

### **Q25. What is the role of the `throw` keyword in C++?**

In C++, the `throw` keyword is used to signal that an exception has occurred. It is followed by an instance of an exception class, which will then be caught by a corresponding `catch` block.

## **üìù Practice Problems**

---

### **Problem 1: File Processing System (Exception Handling, Resource Management) üìÅ**

**Scenario:**  
You are developing a file processing system that reads from and writes to files. The system should handle various exceptions such as file not found, I/O errors, and invalid file formats. Implement exception handling to ensure proper resource management and meaningful error reporting.

#### Requirements:

- Use `try-catch-finally` or equivalent constructs to manage file operations.
- Handle exceptions like `FileNotFoundException`, `IOException`, and custom exceptions for invalid formats.
- Ensure that files are properly closed even if an exception occurs.

üõ†Ô∏è **Ensure**:

- Resources are released properly.
- Appropriate error messages are displayed to the user.
- Exception handling is comprehensive and covers all potential issues.

---

### **Problem 2: Banking Application (Custom Exceptions, Exception Chaining) üí∞**

**Scenario:**  
Develop a banking application that handles various types of banking transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. Implement custom exceptions for invalid transactions, and use exception chaining to provide detailed error information.

#### Requirements:

- Create custom exception classes for specific banking errors (e.g., `InsufficientFundsException`, `InvalidTransactionException`).
- Use exception chaining to provide additional context about errors.
- Ensure that transactions are rolled back in case of exceptions.

üõ†Ô∏è **Ensure**:

- Custom exceptions are well-defined and used appropriately.
- Exception chaining provides valuable debugging information.
- Transaction integrity is maintained even in case of errors.
